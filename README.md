# Investment Trends of Climate-Tech Startups Since 2016
As a final project for a data science class, I along with a partner analyzed investments trends of various climate tech startups since 2016. 

## Abstract
While past research has focused on climate tech investment over the past 5 years, that data has focused on amount of funding overall. Our research aims to focus on how presidencies and policies have specifically shaped climate tech investment, and instead of looking at funding, we viewed the quantity of startups invested. With the past 3 presidencies significantly affecting climate investment, we selected data from climate venture capital firms starting from 2016 to present day, focusing on the 5 main climate sectors: Energy, Food & Agriculture, Carbon Technology, Industrial Decarbonization, and Transportation. We found Food & Agriculture to have decreased while Energy to have increased. COVID-19 & Biden’s term also saw startup increases in sectors.

## Research Questions
Some questions we set out to address were: How has the number of investments in different climate sector startups changed within the past three presidencies? What language commonly appears in each startup’s startup descriptions? Are there patterns in investment timing that correlate with major climate or policy events? 


## Conclusion
Overall startup investment peaked mid-presidency for both terms, with Energy increasingly gaining traction and Food & Agriculture decreasing over time. Not enough data has been conducted in 2025 to discern the current presidency’s impact. Future research should expand to more VCs and analyze the current presidency’s impact when there’s more data.
